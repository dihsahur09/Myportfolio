       <p>I am Balbuena farncis joseph and i am currently a senior high school student, working hard to complete my studies and graduate successfully. 
	   Education is very important to me, and I take my academic journey seriously, especially in subjects like mathematics, science, and technology. 
	   These subjects not only interest me but also align with my future goals. Since childhood, I have been curious about how buildings, machines, and 
	   structures are made, and this curiosity has only grown stronger over the years. Now, I am determined to pursue a career that fits my passion and interests. 
	   After high school, I plan to go to college and choose a course related to either engineering or architecture. I believe both careers offer the chance to solve 
	   real-world problems and make a positive impact. Engineering excites me because it involves designing, building, and improving systems, while architecture appeals 
	   to me for its creativity and the process of designing functional and beautiful spaces</p>
	   
	   <p>I enjoy creating drawings and imagining new designs, but I also love logic and problem-solving, which are essential in engineering. At this point, I’m exploring 
	   both paths to decide which suits me best. I’ve been researching what engineers and architects do in their daily work and watching documentaries and reading about 
	   their contributions to society. I am deeply inspired by their achievements and the lasting impact of their work. I want to be someone who contributes to society 
	   through innovation and design. My dream is to build things that are useful, safe, and beautiful—whether bridges, machines, homes, or public spaces. I understand that 
	   to reach this goal, I must continue studying hard and stay focused on my path. I plan to apply to universities with strong engineering or architecture programs and am 
	   also looking into scholarships to help support my education. My family supports my dream, and I am motivated to make them proud. I know the journey will be challenging
	   but I am ready for it and excited about the future. I will use my education as a tool to build a successful career. Becoming an engineer or architect is not just a 
	   job for me—it is my passion and purposeI understand that the road ahead will not be easy. Becoming an engineer or architect requires dedication, patience, and years 
	   of study and practice. But I am ready for that challenge. I am currently researching colleges and universities that offer strong programs in both fields and am also 
	   looking into scholarships and other opportunities to support my education. My family is supportive of my goals, and I am deeply motivated to make them proud and 
	   create a better future for myself. I believe that through hard work, continuous learning, and passion, I will be able to achieve my dreams. Becoming an engineer or 
	   architect is not just a career choice for me—it is something I am passionate about, and it represents the kind of meaningful and creative work I want to do for the 
	   rest of my life.</p>
	   
	   <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have remained committed to my education because I believe it is the foundation of my future. I take my studies seriously, 
	   particularly in subjects such as mathematics, physics, science, and technology. These subjects have always interested me, and over time, they have become even more
	   meaningful as I begin to seriously think about my future careerAs I approach graduation, I am taking steps to plan for my future. After finishing high school, 
	   I fully intend to go to college and study a course related to either engineering or architecture. I am drawn to both fields for different reasons. Engineering excites 
	   me because it involves problem-solving, innovation, and the application of scientific and mathematical principles to create real-world solutions. 
	   I want to learn how to design and build systems, machines, or structures that help people and solve practical challenges. On the other hand, 
	   architecture also inspires me because it blends creativity and technical knowledge to design spaces that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. 
	   I enjoy sketching and thinking about how buildings are laid out, how space is used, and how design can influence the way people feel and interact with their 
	   environment.Right now, I am exploring both options by researching universities, reading books and articles, and watching videos about what engineers and architects 
	   do in their day-to-day work. I’ve been learning about famous engineers and architects, and I am truly inspired by the incredible things they’ve accomplished. Their 
	   work shapes the world we live in—from roads and bridges to homes, hospitals, and skyscrapers. I want to be part of that. I want to make a difference through my work, 
	   whether I end up building infrastructure that helps communities or designing spaces that people live and work in every day. My long-term goal is to have a career 
	   where I can be proud of what I create and know that my work is helping others</p>
